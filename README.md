# Bingo-Python-5x5-Matrix-Individual-Project-

Developed a terminal-based bingo game in Python that generates a random 5x5 card, receives 
player's choices, and marks hits in real-time. Implemented checks for rows, columns, and 
diagonals to determine Bingo.
Project Details
- Technologies Python standard library, lists and matrices (2D lists), control flows, input
validation
- Random Generation Creates a 5x5 card with unique numbers 1â€“25 via a helper matrix
that prevents duplicates
- User Interaction The player inputs unique numbers within the valid range; incorrect or
duplicate selections are handled robustly
- Matching and Rendering Hits are marked as 'x' in a display matrix; non-hits are shown as
a dot ('.') for a clear overview
- Win Logic Algorithms to detect a full row, column, and both diagonals (BINGO) after
each round


- Data Structure Design Separate matrices for the original card, status, and display to
simplify logic and debugging
- Testing and Verification Manual test cases for input, duplicate protection, boundary
values, and win conditions, with console output for traceability
- Future Development (Suggestions) Scorekeeping, multiple game rounds, unit tests, and
modular separation into functions and classes for better reusability

Here is an example runing for the program:
